# Looping 
logging is repate a block of cade that i want it ti repate or sigle statement more than once depend on me and how much value i assigend to the counter .

Thier is three type of Looping :
- **For Loop** :
  for runs my code to a specific number which is ussually names **"Counters"** 
  
  # For(var i=0; i<10;i++){}
  - i : is the start run 
  - i<number : condion to repate looping until a spesific number
  - i++ : it is increment the sart value to run with loop
  - {} : between the {} is the bolck of statement that i want to run it 
  
- **while** loop :
  it  runs my code to a unspecefic number becuase it i not know how much time is the condion will run
  
  # While(condition){}
  - condion : is to condion that will run untile it become false
  - {} : between the {} is the bolck of statement that i want to run it
  
- Do While:
  it is the same while but do while the do statement will run once  whether the condion met or not 
  
  # do { text += "The number is " + i;   i++; } while (i < 5);
  - do : where the statement will run once it met the conditon or not met
  - while : we will but a comditon

# Comparison operator :

operator | example 
-------- | --------
== | 1==2 (is 1 eaqual 1)
!= | 1!=2 (is i not equal 2)
=== | 1==='3' (is 1 and 3 have the same data type)
!=== | 1=== 1 (is is 1 and 3 not have the same data type)
>  | 1>1 (is grater than 1)
>= | 1>=1 (is 1 grater or equal than 1)
<= | 1<=1 (is 1 less or equal than 1)
<  | 1<=1 (is 1 grater than 1)

oerator    | example 
---------- | ----------
== | 1==2 (is 1 eaqual 1)
!= | 1!=2 (is i not equal 2)
=== | 1==='3' (is 1 and 3 have the same data type)
!=== | 1=== 1 (is is 1 and 3 not have the same data type)
> | 1>1 is grater than 1
>= | 1>=1 is 1 grater or equal than 1
<= | 1<=1 is 1 less or equal than 1
< | 1<=1 is 1 grater than 1
