#### Html + Css +JS
  Starting with the HTML layer allows you to focus on the most important thing about your site: its content. Being plain HTML, this layer should work on all kinds of devices, be    accessible to all users, and load quite quickly on slow connections.Adding the CSS rules in a separate file keeps rules regarding how the page looks away from the content itself.
  The JavaScript is added last and enhances the usability of the page or the experience of interacting with the site.

  When the browser comes across a <script> element, it stops to load the script and then checks to see if it needs to do anything.
  
  ## Note 
   - The HTML <script> element is used in HTML pages to tell the browser to load the JavaScript file (rather like the <link> element can be used to load a CSS file).
   - The JavaScript will not have changed the HTML, because the script works with the model of the web page that the browser has created.

     It store the data .The use of variables to represent numbers or other kinds of data is very similar to the concept of algebra. we define a varible like this :
     
   # **Var variable Name = value**
     
   dataType | example 
   -------- | --------
   number | var x=1
   string | x='s'
   boolean | x=true
     
     
  # RULES FOR NAMING VARIABLES
  1. The name must begin with a letter, dollar sign ($),or an underscore (_). It must not start with a number.
  2. The name can contain letters, numbers, dollar sign ($), or an underscore (_). Note that you must not use a dash(-) or a period (.) in a variable name.
  3. You cannot use keywords or reserved words. Keywords are special words that tell the interpreter to do something. 
  4. All variables are case sensitive,so score and Score would be different variable names
  5. Use a name that describes the kind of information that the variable stores. For example, firstName might be used to store a person's first name
