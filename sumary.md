How do you process and design your site ?
in this section we will discuss the process that will make it to design your website
1-understand ho your target audience is
2-why they would come to your site
3-what information they want to find and when they are likely to return

- Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.
- Wireframes allow you to organize the information that will need to go on each page.

Some Recomended:
1- Now that you know who your visitors are, you need to consider why they are coming. While some people will simply chance across your website, most will visit for a specific reason.
2- It is unlikely that you will be able to list every reason why someone visits your site but you are looking for key tasks and motivations. This information can help guide your site designs.
3-You know who is coming to your site and why they are coming, so now you need to work out what information they need in order to achieve their goals quickly and effectively.
4-Some sites benefit from being updated more frequently than others. Some information (such as news) may be constantly changing, while other content remains relatively static.
