### CSS Color


# How to specify colors?
coloring provide my page with a live style so you can color your text.
there are three common ways in which you can indicate your choice of colors :

1. RGB values : These express colors in terms of how much red, green and blue are used to make it up. For example: rgb(100,100,90)
2. HEX codes : These are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red, green and blue in a color, preceded by a pound or hash #sign. For example: #ee3e80
3. Color names : There are 147 predefined color names that are recognized by browsers. For example: DarkCyan

Tag  | Exampel
---- | ----
color name | h1 { color: DarkCyan;}
hex code | h2 {color: #ee3e80;}
rgb value | p {color: rgb(100,100,90);}

# Background color?
By default, most browser windows have a white background,You can specify your choice of background color in the same three ways you can specify foreground colors: RGB values, hex codes, and color names , If you do not specify a background color, then the background is transparent. 

##Note 
We have also used the padding property to separate the text from the edges of the boxes, This makes it easier to read.


# Color terminology and contrast?
When picking foreground and background colors, it is important to ensure that there is enough contrast for the text to be legible.
